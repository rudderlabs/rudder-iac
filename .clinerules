# Cline Rules for Rudder IAC

## Process Workflows

### Linear Issue Management

1. Issue Status Updates

   - Issue status is automatically updated by GitHub PR status
   - DO NOT manually update issue status
   - Wait for GitHub automation to reflect changes

2. Implementation Process
   - Review and understand issue requirements
   - Make necessary code changes
   - Implement comprehensive tests
   - Submit PR for review
   - Let automation handle status updates

### Code Changes

1. Model Updates

   - Always test YAML parsing after schema changes

2. Testing Requirements
   - Write tests before submitting PR
   - Validate against existing YAML configs
   - Verify reference resolution still works
   - Check for breaking changes

## Project Conventions

1. YAML Configuration

   - Use `name` for actual field/event names
   - Use `display_name` only for UI display purposes
   - Document schema changes clearly

2. Pull Request Process

   - Implementation complete with tests
   - PR triggers status updates in Linear
   - Wait for automated status updates

3. Commit Messages
   - Use conventional commits format
   - Type prefix based on module (e.g. `feat(cli)`, `fix(api)`)
   - Don't include Linear issue in commit title (it's in branch name)
   - First commit's title becomes PR title when squash merged
