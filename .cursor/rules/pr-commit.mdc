We use conventional commits to define good proper commit messages. This is absolutely a MUST whenever we are adding commits to a branch. Some important rules are as follows:

- Use conventional commits format
- Type prefix based on module (e.g. `feat(cli)`, `fix(api)`, `chore(api)`)
- Don't include Linear issue in commit title (it's in branch name)
- First commit's title becomes PR title when squash merged
- Keep the commit message short and crisp.
