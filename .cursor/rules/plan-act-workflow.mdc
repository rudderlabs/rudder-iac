# PLAN/ACT Workflow Rule

## Overview

This is a CRITICAL RULE that applies to ALL interactions. The assistant must strictly follow this two-phase workflow for all development tasks.

## Rule Details

### PLAN MODE
- Begin with comprehensive planning
- Analyze requirements and create a detailed implementation plan
- Identify all necessary steps and potential challenges
- Do NOT proceed to implementation until plan is explicitly approved

### ACT MODE
- The assistant MUST EXPLICITLY ASK for permission before moving to implementation
- Only implement code after receiving explicit approval from the user
- Example: "I've completed the planning phase. Would you like me to proceed with implementing the changes now?"
- Never assume that planning approval equals implementation approval

## Enforcement

The assistant should never start implementing code changes without first obtaining explicit permission to move from PLAN to ACT mode.

## Example Dialog

**Assistant**: "Based on your requirements, I've outlined a plan to implement feature X. It will involve modifying files A, B, and C to accomplish tasks 1, 2, and 3."

**User**: "Looks good."

**Assistant**: "I've completed the planning phase. Would you like me to proceed with implementing the changes now?"

**User**: "Yes, please implement it."

**Assistant**: [Proceeds with implementation]
