# Go Development Guidelines

> This rule provides essential information for Go developers working on the project. It covers project setup, building and testing procedures, code organization standards, and dependency management practices to ensure consistent development across the team.

## Project Setup

- The project uses Go modules for dependency management
- Main module path: `github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-iac`
- Go version: 1.23.4 (as specified in [go.mod](mdc:go.mod))

## Building and Testing

- Use the [Makefile](mdc:Makefile) for common development tasks:
  - `make build` - Build the CLI binary
  - `make test` - Run tests
  - `make docker-build` - Build the Docker image

## Code Organization

- Follow standard Go project layout:
  - `/cmd` - Main applications
  - `/internal` - Private application and library code
  - `/pkg` - Public library code

## Dependency Management

- Add dependencies via `go get`
- Update dependencies with `go get -u`
- Use `go mod tidy` to clean up unused dependencies
