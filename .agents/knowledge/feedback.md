## RUD-2963 — Optional Feature Predicate Naming
<!-- ticket:RUD-2963 -->
- Use `APIError.FeatureFlagNotEnabled()` as the public predicate name when detecting either recognized HTTP 403 feature/flag-disabled response; keep client callers and tests consistent with that name.
- Describe the two recognized API message prefixes neutrally, without assigning lifecycle labels such as legacy or GA to either one.

## DEX-608 — Destination Unverified Gate Documentation
<!-- ticket:DEX-608 -->
- When documenting or commenting on destination E2E unverified gating, do not describe HTTP as the only remaining unverified destination; the unverified registry can include multiple definitions such as `attentive_tag`, `http`, and `rs`, while S3 is verified/native.
